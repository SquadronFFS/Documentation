## Your Plane Identification during a flight
Standard Structure to your Identification:
```
<Callsign> - <Your position in flight>
```

```
Example for Wingman:
```

```

## Adressing Others in a Flight
You state who you are talking to followed by who you are:
```
<Reciever> this is <Transmitter>
```
Often abbreviated to "One this is two" in small flights
- __Reciever__ is who you are talking to.
- __Transmitter__ is YOU

### Examples:
Example:
```
One this is two, I am on final.
```
or
```
Lancer 1 this is Eagle 1, we are in the Area of Operation
```

## Spotting Contacts and Targets
You call out contact to denote an unidentified aircraft:
```
<Reciever> this is <Transmitter>, <Designation> <Direction> <Elevation>
```
- __Designation__ is either *Contact* for not ID'd or *Bandit* for hostile
- __Direction__ is clock face direction on the lateral plane, nose is *12 O'Clock*
- __Elevation__ is  either *high, co-alt, or low*. The position on the verticle plane
- __Distance__ optionally distance to the target may also be added, *5k away*


Reciever should resepond with eiter *tally* or *no joy* 

### Example
Your transmisision as lancer two:
```
Lancer 1 this is lancer 2, contact spotted 2 O'clock high 
```
Lancer One's response that he sees it:
```
Lancer 2 this is Lancer 1, Tally contact
```

They could also ID the target:
```

```
And your response as Lancer two:

```

## Formations
Lead will give a formation command:
```
Flight this is Lead, <Fomration Type>
```
Formation Types Include:
- __Echelon Left__ which means all planes line up off the 8 O'Clock of lead.
- __Echelon Right__ which means all planes line up off the 4 O'Clock of lead.
- __V Formation__ planes equally distributed on both 8 and 4 O'Clock of lead.
- __Column__ planes lined up nose to tail in a line
- __Finger Four__ in a four plane flight leads wingman is at his 8 and the element lead is at his 4 followed by element wingman at the element leads 4
- __Saddle Right__ at the leads 4
- __Saddle Left__ at the leads 8

### Examples
As a member of a formation you may loose site of your lead, it's ok, it happens just make sure you call it out quick:
```
Lancer 1 this is 2, I am blind
```
This means you do not see the lead.

Reponse by lead:
```
Two this is lead, check 10 O'Clock Low
```

Your response:
```
Lead this is two, visual
```

## Attacker and Bomber Communication Examples
Check in with any Fighters in the Area:
```
Lancer flight is in the AO
```
Means Lancer flight has entered the Area of Operation, you may also want to give a warning when you are 10km out.

### Lead will give a heads up to his flight what the intended plan is.
```
Lancer Flight this is Lead, column formation attack in formation.
```
Means the lead intends for you to attack the target sequentially in column formation.

```
Lancer Flight this is lead, engage at will
```
This allows the flight to engage targets at their discretion.  When this is used it is important flight memeber communicate their attack runs, for example....
```
Lancer 2 is IN from South to North
```
This use to call out your attack run.

```
Lancer 2 is OUT
```

### Bombers
Bombers may only make a single pass for this reason the may just call an *ingress* and *egress* heading.
```
Lancer flight, ingress from the north egress to the west.
```
The above means the flight will make it's run from the north and then turn and head west as soon as ordinance is dropped.
